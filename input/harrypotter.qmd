## 6/10

Nowadays it is really hard to find someone who hasn't heard of Harry Potter.
The series first book is just behind the Bible as the most sold book of all time.
The fantasy series is about a young boy who discovers he's a wizard and is invited to
study in the Hogwarts Wizard School.

He discovers, among other things, that his parents were actually murdered by an evil wizard,
Lord Voldemort, and not killed in a car crash as he'd been told...
The books show us the time Harry spends at Hogwarts, the friendships he makes and the
challenges he faces.
