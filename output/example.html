</p><h1>This website was created using Rocky Raccoon
</h1><p>
</p><p>Rocky Raccoon is a static website generator, which attempts to make it easier to create simple web pages, such as personal blogs and online portifolios.
</p><p>
</p><h1>Features
</h1><p>
</p><p>Rocky Raccoon's language is like Markdown, easy and intuitive to use. If you want to make a title you just need to put a '#' in the beginning of the line. A subtitle? '##'. And for regular text you just write normally.
</p><p>
</p><p>Another thing that Rocky Raccoon implements is templates. A template is like a general theme that you want your site to have. Have you ever noticed that in every page of a site that are always some permanent elements to the design? Look at <a href="example2.html">this</a> other page for instance.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It is also very extensible. Let's say you want to implement this feature: if the first word of the line is "LINK", create a link where the next word is the address and all the others are the link text. Because of RR's simplicity, it only takes adding two lines to the parse.py file.
